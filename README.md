## Description
I've been task with making an SVG logo maker. I have created code for index.js, a lib folder containing shapes.js and shapes.test.js.
When I start the application in terminal.
I can enter up to three characters when I am prompted for text.
I can enter a color keyword (OR a hexadecimal number) when I am prompted for the text color.
I am presented with a list of shapes to choose from: circle, triangle, and square when I am prompted for a shape.
I am prompted for the shape's color then I am presented with a list of shapes to choose from: circle, triangle, and square.
I have entered input for all the prompts then I can enter a color keyword (OR a hexadecimal number).
The output text "Generated logo.svg" is printed in the command line then an SVG file is created named `logo.svg`.
