# Louis-Module-11-Express.js
## Description
I've been task with making and deploying this code on render. 
I am presented with a landing page with a link to a notes page when I open the Note Taker.
I am presented with a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column when I click on the link to the notes page.
A "Save Note" button and a "Clear Form" button appear in the navigation at the top of the page when I enter a new note title and the note’s text/
The new note I have entered is saved and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes and the buttons in the navigation disappear when I click on the Save button.
That note appears in the right-hand column and a "New Note" button appears in the navigation when I click on an existing note in the list in the left-hand column.
I am presented with empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column and the button disappears when I click on the "New Note" button in the navigation at the top of the page.
Lastly I made sure to leave the code better than I found it.
